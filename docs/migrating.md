# Migrating from GenAI-Perf

AIPerf is designed to be a drop-in replacement for [GenAI-Perf](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/perf_analyzer/tree/main/genai-perf) _for currently supported features_. Most options from GenAI-Perf map directly to AIPerf options. Options that don't are noted below.
Some options, primarily for the `analyze` subcommand, are not yet supported; they're planned for future releases.

See the [GenAI-Perf vs AIPerf CLI Feature Comparison Matrix](genai-perf-feature-comparison.md) for a detailed comparison of the supported CLI options.

## Known CLI Argument Differences

- `--max-threads`: You no longer need to set a max-thread option. Previously, this was a global setting to control GenAI-Perf total thread count.
AIPerf provides more-fine grained control of the number of workers issuing requests to the endpoint by using the `--workers-max` option.
- `--`: The passthrough args flag is no longer required. All options are now natively supported by AIPerf.

To migrate your previous GenAI-Perf commands to AIPerf commands, remove the above options.

## Input File Format Changes

The format for the `inputs.json` file, which contains the input prompts used in benchmarking, has changed slightly from GenAI-Perf to AIPerf:

- **`payload` â†’ `payloads`**: The singular `payload` field has been renamed to `payloads` (plural).
- **Conversation turns**: Each item in the `payloads` array now represents a turn in a conversation/session, providing better support for multi-turn interactions.
- **`session_id` field**: A new `session_id` field has been added to each entry. This enables correlation between requests and payloads for future analytics and tracking purposes.

These changes allow AIPerf to better handle conversational workloads and provide more detailed traceability for performance analysis.
